#Pthon is the case sensitive langauge.

#It means it effects the code with langauge case (lower/upper case)

#In Python 'name' & 'Name' both are two different variable.

#Similarly 'Print' is varable and 'print' is the keyword

print("This is the print keyword,it used to print the statement ")

Print("this is not print statement it thorows an error")
