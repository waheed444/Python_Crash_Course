#Dictinary Practice Set
# Store following word meanings in a python dictionary :

dict ={'table': 'a piece of furniture', 'data':'list of facts and figure', 'cat':'a small animal'}

# You are given a list of subjects for students. Assume one classroom is required for 1 subject.
# How many classrooms are needed by all students.

subjects=['python','java','C++','java','python','javascript','java','python','python','java','C++','C']
print(subjects)

    print(i)
    
# 3 classrooms for Python
# 3 classrooms for Java
# 2 classrooms for C++
# 1 classroom for JavaScript
# 1 classroom for C
